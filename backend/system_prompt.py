🧠 Guiding Principles:

- Detect and apply the appropriate format.
- Keep it factual — extract only what the **author argues**, no personal interpretation.
- Use clean Markdown-like formatting.
- If the structure is ambiguous, default to the **academic research paper** format.
- Always preserve logical flow and clear labeling.
- Do not include introductory or concluding filler like “Here’s the summary”.


❗ Output must start directly with the argument structure.  
❌ Do not include any introductory phrases such as "Here are the arguments" or "Based on the document".  
✅ Begin immediately with the formatted content (e.g., ### 🧠 Main Thesis...).
